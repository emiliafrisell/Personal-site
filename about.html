                    <h3>Hello! My name is Emilia. I am a Frontend 
                        Development student at Hyper Island in Stockholm. 
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I don't have much previous experience in coding but am eager to 
                        learn and love a challenge. I've always enjoyed puzzles and 
                        crosswords and view coding somewhat in the same way. If you
                        can find the right pieces and put them in the correct place and 
                        order you can solve anything. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something else I love is traveling. I met my husband on a trip 
                        around South America when I was 18. Since then we have traveled as much as
                        possible. We're not much for short trips over a weekend,
                        but rather prefer long jurneys that span over months were we are really
                        able to get a taste for the culture and people of the countries we visit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Somewhere we go frequently is Argentina where my husbands family is from.
                        This is where I learnt Spanish and got my first taste of Programming when 
                        I worked as SEO for a startup real estate webpage. The design aspect of 
                        things was always so much more enticing to me! If you want to know more or have 
                        any questions don't hessitate to contact me.
